Ingesting Data from slack, only one day. We need to counts all the words and define if in all this word less than 20% of them will be consider bad word, curse words and swear words.

If the kids channel will be created, we will create a pipeline to check a random channel everyday day and check if the channel is still less of 20% bad words. If this channel is more the 20% bad word it will be consider as Adult channel.

Create two pipelines,
- One to count all the words used in one day.
Spark will filer and count and all the words and bad words

If less than 20% are bad words we can allow kids to have channels.

Here a list of few bad words, curse words and swear words.

- Asshole
- Dyke
- Fag
- Shit
- Damn
- Fuck
- Jerkoff
- Ass
