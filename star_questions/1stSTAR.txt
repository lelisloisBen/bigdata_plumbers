how did you deal with it?
what was the outcome?

# A1
I was working on a group project, we had to finsih to build a pipeline before the week.
One of my coworker was late and frustated.
I asked him what was the issue and he reacted agresivly.
Then I asked him how can i assit him.
He calm down and we found a way to fix his issue.
I learned that is't better to ask help right away to avoid the frustation and meet
the deadline.

# Q2
Give me an example when you worked on a team.
What was your role?
What was the outcome?

# A2
I was working on a pipeline on my last project with my coworkers,
I was using Apache-Spark and Python to filer the data by date and removing special characters.
I think I'm more successful at work when I have a team to support me.
We were Having group meeting in the mornings and afternoons to share our progress.
I learned that working as a team give you motivation and help to know the team better.

#Q1
Tell me about a situation that represented a challenge and how did you dea with it?

#A1
I was working in a project ingesting data from a public API
and one week before the deadline there was a major update in the API.
After that, almost 40% of my code was useless so I had to work extra hours to solve the problem.
What I learned was that it is always good to ask to the API developers if there will be updates.

#Q2
Tell me about a time you did a mistake and how did you deal with it?

#A2
Once I was ingesting data from an API with an AWS instance and I forgot to stop the process.
That mistake costed a couple of hundreds to the company so I talked with y boss about the situation.
He told me that everything was good and that that was not a big deal.
I learned to be more careful with my processes, even more when dealing with AWS machines.
